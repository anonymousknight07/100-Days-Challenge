# 100 Days of Coding Challenge
Welcome to the 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! This challenge is designed to help you build a coding habit, enhance your skills, and make consistent progress in your programming journey over the next 100 days.

# Overview
The 100 Days of Coding Challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced coder, this challenge is a great way to reinforce your existing knowledge and explore new areas of interest.

# Getting Started
#### Fork this Repository:
  Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the challenge materials that you can modify and track your progress.

#### Clone the Repository: 
  Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
  - ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/100-days-of-coding
    ```
#### Create a Branch: 
  Create a new branch for each day of the challenge. 
  For example:
- ```
  git checkout -b day-1
  ```
#### Code and Commit: 
  Spend at least one hour coding, working on a project, solving coding challenges, or learning something new. Commit your changes to your branch.
#### Push Changes: 
  Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- ```
  git push origin day-1
  ```
#### Create a Pull Request: 
  Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. This will allow others to see your progress and provide feedback.
#### Repeat:
  Repeat the process for the next 99 days, creating a new branch for each day.
# Guidelines
#### Consistency is Key: 
  The goal is to code for at least one hour every day. Consistency is more important than the complexity of your code.
#### Document Your Journey: 
  Use the README.md file in your daily branches to document your progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Share code snippets, resources, and any insights you gain during the challenge.
#### Engage with the Community:
  Join the Discussions to connect with other participants, share your experiences, and ask for help if needed.
#### Explore New Technologies:
  Take this opportunity to explore technologies, frameworks, or languages you've been curious about.
